## :scroll: Description
A simple, yet beautiful weather app done with Jetpack Compose.

A special thank you to [@henrikemacedo](https://twitter.com/henrikemacedo) who designed this beautiful UI.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Played with Jetpack Compose to create a simple, yet beautiful weather app made entirely with Jetpack Compose. The app supports two theme modes: light and night which can be changed by either activiating the night mode on the device or changing it on runtime inside the app settings.
